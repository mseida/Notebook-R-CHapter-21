This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Chapter 21:

Reducing code duplication has three main benefits:

It’s easier to see the intent of your code, because your eyes are drawn to what’s different, not what stays the same.

It’s easier to respond to changes in requirements. As your needs change, you only need to make changes in one place, rather than remembering to change every place that you copied-and-pasted the code.

You’re likely to have fewer bugs because each line of code is used in more places.

functions: reduce duplication by identifying repeated patterns of code and extract them out into independent pieces that can be easily reused and updated

iteration: when you need to do the same thing to multiple inputs: repeating the same operation on different columns, or on different datasets

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
df <- tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)
```

```{r}
output <- vector("double", ncol(df))  # 1. output
for (i in seq_along(df)) {            # 2. sequence
  output[[i]] <- median(df[[i]])      # 3. body
}
output
```

Every for loop has three components:

The output: output <- vector("double", length(x)). A general way of creating an empty vector of given length is the vector() function. It has two arguments: the type of the vector (“logical”, “integer”, “double”, “character”, etc) and the length of the vector.

The sequence: i in seq_along(df). It’s useful to think of i as a pronoun, like “it”.

The body: output[[i]] <- median(df[[i]]). This is the code that does the work. 


```{r}
output <- vector("double", ncol(mtcars))
names(output) <- names(mtcars)
for (i in names(mtcars)) {
  output[i] <- mean(mtcars[[i]])
}
output
```

There are four variations on the basic theme of the for loop:

**Modifying an existing object, instead of creating a new object.**

```{r}
df <- tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)
  rescale01 <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
}
  
  for (i in seq_along(df)) {
  df[[i]] <- rescale01(df[[i]])
}
```

**Looping over names or values, instead of indices.**
Loop over the elements: for (x in xs). 

Loop over the names: for (nm in names(xs)). This gives you name, which you can use to access the value with x[[nm]]. This is useful if you want to use the name in a plot title or a file name.

**Handling outputs of unknown length.**
Save the results in a list, and then combine into a single vector after the loop is done:
Handling sequences of unknown length.


A while loop is also more general than a for loop, because you can rewrite any for loop as a while loop, but you can’t rewrite every while loop as a for loop.

If there are no names, there will be an error code or just zero iterations for the loop

Dont want to copy and paste code as more room for bugs 

Why use purr?
Purrr takes care of generalising your solution to every element in the list.
With purrr, you get lots of small pieces that you can compose together with the pipe.

Purr functions:
map() makes a list.
map_lgl() makes a logical vector.
map_int() makes an integer vector.
map_dbl() makes a double vector.
map_chr() makes a character vector.

Way less work thatn a loop! And less typing!
```{r}
map_dbl(df, mean)

map_dbl(df, median)

map_dbl(df, sd)

```

```{r}
map_dbl(mtcars, mean)
map_chr(nycflights13::flights, typeof)
length(unique(iris$Species))
```

safely() takes a function (a verb) and returns a modified version. It always returns a list with two elements:

result is the original result. If there was an error, this will be NULL.

error is an error object. If the operation was successful, this will be NULL.

```{r}
x <- list(1, 10, "a")
y <- x %>% map(safely(log))
str(y)
```

```{r}
y <- y %>% transpose()
str(y)
```
possibly() is simpler than safely() because you give it a default value to return when there is an error
